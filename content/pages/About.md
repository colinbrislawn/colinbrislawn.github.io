Title: About & CV

My name is Colin Brislawn. I'm a native of the Pacific Northwest who loves building elegant things with passionate people.
I'm pursuing a career in computational biology because I value open science, multi-omics, and data visualization.

## About this site

I built this to learn about static site generation with [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) and [Python](https://www.python.org/).
Later, I may use this to showcase my work, but for now it's a learning experience.

Specifically, I want to lean more about

* deploying static sites on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/)
* modifying Pelican themes using Jinja2 templates
* displaying images or a gallery of images
* displaying IPython / [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)
* maybe automating builds using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org)
* maybe adding comments with [Disqus ](https://disqus.com/)
